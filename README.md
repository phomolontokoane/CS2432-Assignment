# CS2434: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Assignment

In a library system, books are stored on a number of shelves. The shelves are distributed over 
a number of floors in the library building. Each shelf is identified by a shelf number. For each 
book, the details stored include title, author and the subject. Each floor has the floor number 
and a floor manager whose details include employment number, rank and the name and 
surname. When a student borrows a book, his details, book details, the location of the book(floor and 
shelf) and the date are captured. Similarly, when a student returns a book the details are 
captured. Student details include Student number, name, surname and the faculty. 
Design a C++ menu driven program to implement the above case. Arrays are used for storage 
of the data. However, a copy of the data stored in the arrays is created in the text files. 
Whenever the system is started the data stored in the text files is loaded into the appropriate 
arrays for manipulation

Implement a menu driven C++ solution that portrays the following functionalities. 

- Create  and display floors
- Create and display shelves for each floor 
- Store and display books in the shelves
- Create a list of borrowed books, storing the students and the location of such books 
and the date borrowed. Also display such books.
- Show the interface that handles returns of books.
- Display the list of books that were returned.
- Display the list of books that are not yet returned.
- Display any relevant reports of interest.

Work in pairs(2) to solve the problem. The pair should be in one practical group. 
Presentation of the programs will be during practical sessions of the week of 21st April 2025.

The following concepts must be portrayed in the programs 

- Constructors 
- Accessors and mutators 
- Friend classes and friend functions 
- Inheritance 
- Templates 
- Polymorphism

There will be a bonus for students who used linked lists in place of arrays.

**Note: Students should show the full understanding of the presented program. Students 
in the program may get different marks if their competence in the program is 
drastically different. Groups which appear to have the same/similar submission will 
share the marks.**
